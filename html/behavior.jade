        h1 Animal behavior
        h2 Defense
        p The male platypus also possesses two small spurs, one on each hind paw. The spurs release enough toxic venom to kill a small animal or be incredibly painful for a human. 
        p While this weapon is used against predators if threatened (the platypus would actually rather run than fight), it is primarily used against other male platypuses during mating season. They fight to show dominance and scare away potential mating rivals.
        h2 Food
        p While submerged underwater, the platypus closes its eyes and ears. In order to hunt, it relies on its bill to sense other animals. The bill, which is actually a soft, leathery snout, has electro-receptors that pick up on the small electrical signals sent by animals when they move. These help the platypus find worms and freshwater shrimp to feed on.
        p The platypus will then store the food in its cheeks and wait to resurface before eating. Although they have no teeth, platypuses have grinding pads in their mouths to crush and grind their food.
        h2 Sleeping
        p The platypus, apparently, is a surprisingly deep sleeper. What’s more, it spends more of its time in so-called ‘REM’ sleep than any other mammal.
        p ‘REM’ stands for ‘rapid eye-movement’ and is the kind of sleep in which the brain can be more active than in it is while awake, the animal twitches, and the eyelids flicker - hence the name. In humans, REM sleep is associated with dreaming.
